- 👋 Hi, I’m @ElodieMillan
- 👩🏻‍🔬 I’m interested in soft matter physics and statistical physics.
- </> I'm coding mostly in `Python` and `Cython`, and I can use `C` and `Matlab`.

I am interested in the field of soft matter physics and statistical physics, from microscopic to macroscopic
scales. I combine experimental physics with numerical modeling to maintain a versatile approach to the
fundamental questions in my research in physics.
My research focuses on particle transport and diffusion at small scales in complex microfluidic environments.
I study the motion of confined particles near rigid boundaries, where hydrodynamic interactions significantly
affect mobility and diffusion behavior [1]. To investigate these effects, I use advanced Langevin dynamics simu-
lations [2, 3].
I also study the formation and drying dynamics of water microdroplets in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a
hydrophobic elastomer, when in contact with water. The addition of sodium chloride or glycerol allows for
control over the droplet concentration [Pingulkar et al., Soft Matter, 2024]. These phenomena are investiga-
ted at the microscale using interferometry, rheology, and physico-chemical analysis, and at the macroscale by
measuring water evaporation through PDMS membranes.
